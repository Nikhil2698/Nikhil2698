Hey! It's <strong> Nikhil Yadav </strong> and I'm a Software Developer located in Tempe, Arizona. I am immensely passionate about technology because I believe it can make the world a better place. My background in both theoretical and practical development allows me to seamlessly translate complex research concepts into tangible solutions that make a real-world impact. If you don't see me coding, I will be at the coffee machine.

I'm always open to collaboration. If you have an interesting idea, if you think I will be a great fit for your team, or even if you want to just grab a cup of coffee, I am always happy to connect!
